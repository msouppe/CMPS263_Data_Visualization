Converted d3 v3 code into d3 v4 code for dendrograms, further coded two examples of dendrograms: linear and radial. Lastly, using similar skeleton for both dendrograms and showing how it is easy to convert from a linear to radial dendrogram with same data. Lastly, creating these examples using my own data.
